This project involves building a machine learning model to predict airline passenger satisfaction using structured survey and service-related data

# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction (ML Project)

This machine learning project predicts whether an airline passenger is satisfied based on travel and service experience data.

## 📌 Project Description

A Logistic Regression model was built to classify customer satisfaction based on features like flight distance, class, inflight services, and boarding experience. The model achieved **86.58% accuracy** and an **AUC Score of 0.92**.

## ✅ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset (25K+ rows)
- Encode categorical variables
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluate using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, LabelEncoder, metrics)

## 📈 Results

- Accuracy (Test): 86.58%
- Accuracy (Train): 86.58%
- AUC Score: 0.92

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. Data cleaning and missing value handling
2. Label encoding categorical features
3. Logistic Regression training
4. Evaluation using classification report and ROC-AUC
5. Visualization of key insights
